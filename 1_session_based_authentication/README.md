# Authentication by setting up a session

**Setting up a session is a way of storing data on server-side.**

In this approach, a session, which has user's information, is set when users enter the system.

Can be implemented in two different ways:
- [Storing sessions in server's memory](https://github.com/cagatayakkus/authentication_in_general/tree/main/1_session_based_authentication/0_store_in_memory)
- [Storing session in database](https://github.com/cagatayakkus/authentication_in_general/tree/main/1_session_based_authentication/1_store_in_database)

## Session

Session can be considered as a cookie stored on server-side.
